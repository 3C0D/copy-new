# 👨‍💻 To compile the application yourself:

### Windows and Linux Version build instructions:

Writing Tools now includes automated build scripts that handle everything for you!

## 🚀 Quick Build (Recommended)

**1. Download the Code**

- Click the green `<> Code ▼` button toward the very top of this page, and click `Download ZIP`.

**2. Build with Automated Scripts**
Navigate to the `Windows_and_Linux` directory and use the build scripts:

- **Development Build (Fast):**

  ```bash
  # Windows
  .\run.bat build-dev

  # Linux
  ./run.sh build-dev
  ```

- **Development Build with Console (For Debugging):**

  ```bash
  # Direct script execution with console visible
  python Windows_and_Linux/scripts/dev_build.py --console
  ```

  This creates a build where the console window remains visible, allowing you to see logs in real-time instead of only in log files.

- **Final Release Build (Clean):**

  ```bash
  # Windows
  .\run.bat build-final

  # Linux
  ./run.sh build-final
  ```

## 🔧 Build Mode Information

**Settings Storage:**

- **build-dev**: Settings stored in `dist/dev/data_dev.json` + debug logs in `dist/dev/debug.log`
- **build-final**: Settings stored in `dist/production/data.json` (same directory as executable)

**Debug Features:**

- **build-dev**: Includes debug file logging to `dist/dev/debug.log` for development analysis
- **build-dev --console**: Same as build-dev but with console visible for real-time log viewing
- **build-final**: Production build with minimal logging

The scripts will automatically:

- ✅ Create a virtual environment (`myvenv/`)
- ✅ Install all required dependencies
- ✅ Build the executable with PyInstaller
- ✅ Copy all necessary assets and configurations
- ✅ Launch the built application (dev-build only)

**Build Output:**

- **build-dev**: Executable and assets in `dist/dev/`
- **build-final**: Executable and assets in `dist/production/`

- Executable: `dist/Writing Tools.exe` (Windows) or `dist/Writing Tools` (Linux)
- Assets: Icons, backgrounds, and configuration files in `dist/`

## 🔧 Manual Build (Advanced Users)

If you prefer manual setup:

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

```bash
# Install virtualenv if you haven't already
pip install virtualenv

# Create a new virtual environment
virtualenv myvenv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
myvenv\Scripts\activate
# On Linux:
source myvenv/bin/activate
```

2. **Install required packages:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Build Writing Tools:**

```bash
python pyinstaller-build-script.py
```

### macOS Version (by [Aryamirsepasi](https://github.com/Aryamirsepasi)) build instructions:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools.git
   ```

3. **Open in Xcode**

   - Open Xcode
   - Select "Open an existing project..." from the options.
   - Navigate to the macOS folder within the WritingTools directory that you cloned previously, and select "writing-tools.xcodeproj"

4. **Configure Project Settings**
