A powerful AI-powered writing assistant that integrates seamlessly with your workflow through system tray access and global hotkeys.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### **Run from Source** (Fastest for development)

```bash
python Windows_and_Linux/scripts/dev_script.py
```

### **Build and Test** (Recommended for testing)

```bash
python Windows_and_Linux/scripts/build_dev.py
```

### **Debug Mode** (When things go wrong)

```bash
python Windows_and_Linux/scripts/build_dev.py --console
```

## ✨ Features

## 🛠️ Development

### **Prerequisites**

- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment (automatically created)
- Windows 10/11 or Linux

### **Development Workflow**

1. **Quick Testing**: `python Windows_and_Linux/scripts/dev_script.py`
2. **Build Testing**: `python Windows_and_Linux/scripts/build_dev.py`
3. **Debug Issues**: `python Windows_and_Linux/scripts/build_dev.py --console`
4. **Production Build**: `python Windows_and_Linux/scripts/build_final.py`

### **VS Code Integration**

All scripts work perfectly with Code Runner:

1. Open any script file
2. Press `Ctrl+F5`
3. Script runs with proper environment setup

##  Troubleshooting

### **Systray Icon Missing**

```bash
# Debug startup issues
python Windows_and_Linux/scripts/startup_debug.py

# For boot-time issues (development only)
python Windows_and_Linux/scripts/setup_dev_autostart.py
```

### **Build Failures**

```bash
# Update dependencies first
python Windows_and_Linux/scripts/update_deps.py

# Then try console mode for detailed output
python Windows_and_Linux/scripts/build_dev.py --console
```

### **Provider Issues**

- Check API keys in Settings
- Verify internet connection
- Try different provider in Settings window
